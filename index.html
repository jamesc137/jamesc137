      <h2>üèôÔ∏è BitNations</h2>
      <p>BitNations is a minimalist nation simulation game that was never officially launched but gained surprising popularity organically within a year of its existence. Initially discovered by users, the game quickly found its way into schools in Sweden, where it was utilized as a learning tool for Model UN. This grassroots interest led to its spread through a network of educational institutions in Sweden and across the U.K. and Europe.</p>
      <p>As students began to engage with the game outside of class, its popularity continued to grow. BitNations eventually expanded beyond Europe, reaching Asia, Australia, California, and now, the globe.</p>
